Vim is a great text editor as you can config almost things you want. The config file `init.vim` can run cross platform. In this post I will share some thought about using vim (actually neovim) in daily and how to make it become more elegant.

### 1. Why Vim/NeoVim?

- Most of the time I, as developer, work on terminal screen so using a text editor in terminal could be a good choice seen I don't have to switch between screens.
- Moving line-by-line in vim is actually faster than normal IDE. Everything you can do with your keyboard and the mouse/trackpad is unneeded.
- Vim is a highly-configurable text editor so you can manage, custom what vim should look like based on your job and personality.
- As I mentioned, using Vim means that you have to work alot with keyboard ... and there is a myriad of mechanical keyboards on the market supporting your work efficiently.

The typing experience on a mechanical keyboard is always better than the experience on a built-in keyboard on your laptop, which would produce a desirable working outcomes on vim.

### 2. Installation

I did write a post about setup on MacOS including vim installation, so you can check it here: https://amanlearnscode.netlify.com/macos-setup/

Base on your need, you can choose between Vim, NeoVim or MacVim. I choose NeoVim as it supports `true color`, making my experience more colorful.

```
brew install neovim
```
<br />

The guides for other operating systems can be found here: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim

### 3. Configuration

Your configuration for neovim is stored in a file called `init.vim`. After install neovim, you can check the file at path `~/.config/nvim/init.vim`

#### Plugin Management

Like Vim, NeoVim needs a plugin management to install all plugins you need. There is some tools you can choose: `Vundle`, `Vim-Plug`. I choose `Vim-Plug` since `Vundle` doesn't maintained anymore.

Vim-Plug: https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug#installation

```
curl -fLo ~/.local/share/nvim/site/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
```
<br />

After install, you can add plugins you need in file `init.vim`. Then you have to reload the file `init.vim` (I usually use `:source%` command instead of restarting neovim). Then you type `:PlugInstall` to allow `Vim-Plug` install all plugins you listed in the file.

There are 2 more command I also use: `PlugUpdate` to update plugins to newer version and `PlugClean` to uninstall plugins unlisted in the file.

#### Dotfile

There are so many developers share dotfile (the file of vim/neovim config) on github, including some interesting plugins that you may need. However

> "Don't put any lines in your init.vim that you don't understand."

#### Theme

The neovim you've installed maybe just a blank black screen. To color it, the fast and easiest way is using a theme. 

Vim/NeoVim colors: https://vimcolors.com

For example, I want to my neovim has the `gruvbox` theme. So I add these lines in the `init.vim` file.

```
call plug#begin('~/.config/nvim/plugged')

Plug 'morhetz/gruvbox'

" Initialize plugin system
call plug#end()

" Set colorscheme
colorscheme gruvbox

" Set dark background
set background=dark

```
<br />

The `morhetz/gruvbox` is split from the path https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox

There are some other configs that I usually use:

#### Enable mouse

```
if has('mouse')
  set mouse=a
endif
```
<br />

#### Show line number

```
set nu
```
<br />

#### Turn on syntax

```
syntax on
```
<br />

#### NERDTree

```
Plug 'scrooloose/nerdtree'
```
<br />

#### Airline

Airline is one of my favorite tools, it supports my neovim looks like an IDE and displays the vim mode, file changed, etc.

### 5. Conclusion

Work perfectly inside terminal and highly configurable are the advantages of vim compared to orthers like VSCode or Sublime 3. But at the beginning, I couldn't move to NeoVim totally since I have to remember tons of command and key maps.

If you use VSCode, there is an extension call Vim mode so you can install and have vim the experience on vscode. It's a good way to start.
