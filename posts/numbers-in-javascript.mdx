JavaScript has only one numeric type, number, including "integer" and fractional decimal numbers.

### Numeric Syntax

Number literals are expressed in JS generally as base-10 decimal literals. For instance:

```javascript
var a = 69
var b = 69.96

// The leading portion of a decimal value, 0, is optional
var c = 0.69
```

<br />

By default, most numbers will be outputted as base-10 decimals, with trailing fractional 0s removed. Very large or very small numbers will by default be outputted in exponent form, the same as the output of the toExponential() method, like:

```javascript
var a = 5e10
a // 50000000000
a.toExponential() // "5e+10"

var b = a * a
b // 2.5e+21

var c = 1 / a
c // 2e - 11
```

<br />

Since Number object wraps number values, number values can access built-in methods of `Number.prototype`. For example:

```javascript
var a = 69.96
a.toFixed(0) // "70"
a.toFixed(1) // "70"
a.toFixed(2) // "69.96"
a.toFixed(3) // "69.960"
a.toFixed(4) // "69.9600"
```

<br />

`toPrecision` is quite similar but specifies how many digits should be used to represent the value:

```javascript
var a = 42.59

a.toPrecision(1) // "4e+1"
a.toPrecision(2) // "43"
a.toPrecision(3) // "42.6"
a.toPrecision(4) // "42.59"
a.toPrecision(5) // "42.590"
```

<br />

There is a notice when using `toFixed` method that since `.` is a valid numeric character, it will first be interpreted as part of a number literal rather than being interpreted as a property accessor:

```javascript
42.toFixed(3); // Syntax Error
```

<br />

There are several ways to fix that issue: `42..toFixed(3)`, `0.42.toFixed(3)`, and `(42).toFixed(3)`. However, with the number literal specifically, this is a particularly confusing coding style and will serve no other purpose but to confuse other developers (and your future self). Avoid it.

### Small Decimal Values

The most famous side effect of using binary floating-point in JavaScript is:

```javascript
0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3 // false
```

<br />

Since the representation for 0.1 and 0.2 in binary floating point are not exact. It's really close 0.30000000000000004. So, if we need to compare two numbers like 0.1 + 0.2 and 0.3, you can use a tiny value called "machine epsilon", which is commonly `2^-52` in JavaScript:

```javascript
if (!Number.EPSILON) {
  Number.EPSILON = Math.pow(2, -52)
}

function numbersCloseEnoughToEqual(num1, num2) {
  return Math.abs(num1 - num2) < Number.EPSILON
}

var a = 0.1 + 0.2
var b = 0.3

numbersCloseEnoughToEqual(a, b) // true
```

<br />

### Testing for Integers

To test if a value is an integer, you can use a ES6-specified `Number.isInteger` or polyfill `.isInteger` for pre-ES6:

```javascript
if (!Number.isInteger) {
  Number.isInteger = function(num) {
    return typeof num === "number" && num % 1 === 0
  }
}
```

<br />

While integers can range up to roughly 9 quadrillion safely (53 bits), there are some numeric operations (like the bitwise operators) that are only defined for 32-bit numbers, so the “safe range” for numbers used in that way must be much smaller.
The range then is `Math.pow(-2,31)` (-2147483648, about –2.1 billion) up to `Math.pow(2,31)-1` (2147483647, about +2.1 billion).

### Special Values

As I mentioned in the previous article, for the `undefined` type, there is only one value, undefined, and for the `null` type, there is only one value, null. There is another way to get undefined value is the `void` operator:

```javascript
var a = 42
console.log(void a, a) // undefined 42
```

<br />

Like C programming language, you'd used `void`. The `void` operator can be useful in a few other circumstances, if you need to ensure that an expression has no result value

```javascript
function doSomethingAwesome() {
  if (!APP.ready) {
    // try again later
    return void setTimeout(doSomethingAwesome, 1000)
  }
  var result
  // do some stuffs
  return result
}

if (doSomethingAwesome()) {
  // handle next tasks right away
}
```

<br />

Many devs, include me, prefer to just do these actions separately, which doesn't use the `void` operator:

```javascript
if (!APP.ready) {
  // try later
  setTimeout(doSomethingAwesome, 1000)
  return
}
```

<br />

### Special Numbers

`NaN` literally stands for "not a number". It would be much more accurate to think of NaN as being an "invalid number".

```javascript
var = 2 / "foo"; // NaN
typeof a === "number"; // true
```

<br />

In other words, "the type of not-a-number is a number". Moreover, if you have a value in some variable and want to test to see if it's this speical failed-number, you can directly compare to NaN itself!

```javascript
var a = 2 / "foo"

a == NaN // false
a === NaN // false
```

<br />

Nope. This is not the solution, we use the built-in global utility called `isNaN` which tells us the value is NaN or not.

```javascript
var a = 2 / "foo"

isNaN(a) // true
```

<br />

However, the `isNaN` has a fatal flaw. The job of this utility is test if the thing passed in is either not a number or number. But it's not quite accurate.

```javascript
var a = 2 / "foo"
var b = "foo"

a // NaN
b // "foo"

window.isNaN(a) // true
window.isNaN(b) // true
```

<br />

Though "foo" is literally not a number, it's deffinitely not the NaN value either as well. This bug exists since the very beginning (19 years ago). A simple polyfill for it so that you can safely check NaN value is:

```javascript
if (!Number.isNaN) {
  Number.isNaN = function(number) {
    return typeof number === "number" && window.isNaN(number)
  }
}

var a = 2 / "foo"
var b = "foo"

Number.isNaN(a) // true
Number.isNaN(b) // false - yes, as we expected!
```

<br />

Another way we can implement `Number.isNaN` polyfill is taking advantage of peculiar fact that NaN isn't equal to itself.

```javascript
if (!Number.isNaN) {
  Number.isNaN = function(number) {
    return n !== n
  }
}
```

<br />

### Infinities

In JavaScript, the operation `var a = 1 / 0` is well-defined and results in value called `Infinity`.

```javascript
var a = 1 / 0 // Infinity
var b = -1 / 0 // -Infinity
```

JS uses finite numeric representations, so it seems it is possible to overflow even with an operation like addition or subtraction.

```javascript
var a = Number.MAX_VALUE // 1.7976931348623157e+308
var b = a + a // Infinity
var c = a + Math.pow(2, 970) // Infinity
var d = a + Math.pow(2, 969) // 1.7976931348623157e+308
```

<br />

`Number.MAX_VALUE + Math.pow(2, 969)` is closer to `Number.MAX_VALUE` than to `Infinity`. If you think too much about that, it’s going to make your head hurt. So don’t. Seriously, stop!

In JS, `infinity / infinity` is not a defined operation. The result is NaN. `finit number / infinity` results 0, and what about `negative finite / infinity`? Keep reading!

### Zeros

In mathematics, there is only one zero (0) value. But, JavaScript has both, a normal zero, 0, and a negative 0, `-0`.

```javascript
var a = 0 / -3 // -0
var b = 0 * -3 // -0
```

<br />

However, if you try to stringify a negative zero value, it will always return 0.

```javascript
var a = 0 / -3

a.toString() // "0"
a + "" // "0"
String(a) // "0"
JSON.stringify(a) // "0"
```

<br />

Meanwhile, the reverse operations don't lie us:

```javascript
;+"-0" // -0
Number("-0") // -0
JSON.parse("-0") // -0
```

<br />

How about the comparision operations? They are also configured to lie:

```javascript
var a = 0
var b = 0 / -3

a == b // true
;-0 == 0 // true

a === b // true
;-0 === 0 // true

0 > -0 // false
a > b // false
```

<br />

So if you want to distinguish a -0 from a 0, you have to be a bit more clever:

```javascript
function isNegativeZero(number) {
  n = Number(number)
  return n === 0 && 1 / n === -Infinity
}

isNegativeZero(-0) // true
isNegativeZero(0 / -3) // true
isNegativeZero(0) // false
```

<br />

There are certain applications where developers use the magnitude of a value to represent one piece of information (like speed of movement per animation frame) and the sign of that number to represent another piece of information (like the direction of that movement). In those applications, as one example, if a variable arrives at zero and it loses its sign, then you would lose the information of what direction it was moving in before it arrived at zero. Preserving the sign of the zero prevents potentially unwanted information loss.

### The `Object.is`

From ES6, there is a new utility that can be used to test two values for absolute equality, it's called `Object.is`

```javascript
var a = 2 / "foo"
var b = -3 * 0

Object.is(a, NaN) // true
Object.is(b, 0) // false
```

<br />

The `Object.is` should be used mostly for these special cases of equality since the `==` and `===` operators are known to be safe enough and much more efficient in practice. We can implement the polyfill for Object.is for pre-ES6 environment:

```javascript
if (!Object.is) {
  Object.is = function(var1, var2) {
    // test for NaN
    if (var1 !== var1) {
      return var2 !== var2
    }
    // test for -0
    if (var1 === 0 && var2 === 0) {
      return 1 / var1 === 1 / var2
    }
  }
}
```

<br />

### Conclusion

The numbers include several special values, like `NaN`, `+Infinity`, `-Infinity` and `-0`. The article discuss some ways that we can deal and avoid weird fact when working with small decimal numbers, making the comparison between two values and compute when the result is 0. The `Object.is` is a useful operation but should only be used in some special cases above.
